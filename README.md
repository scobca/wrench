# Wrench

![Wrench CI](https://github.com/ryukzak/wrench/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)

This is an educational project designed to explore different types of processor architectures. It includes simple CPU models and assemblers for them.

- `wrench` -- translator/simulator itself
- `wrench-fmt` -- formatter for assembly files
- `wrench-serv` -- service for uploading and running testcases

## Documentation

- [General Assembly Documentation](./docs/README.md) -- Explanation of how assembly source code and simulation configuration files should be structured (ISA-agnostic)
- Architecture specific documentation:
    - [Acc32](./docs/acc32.md) -- Accumulator-based 32-bit architecture
    - [F32a](./docs/f32a.md) -- Stack-based 32-bit architecture
    - [M68k](./docs/m68k.md) -- Motorola 68000-inspired architecture
    - [RISC-IV](./docs/risc-iv.md) -- RISC-V-inspired 32-bit architecture
    - [VLIW-IV](./docs/vliw-iv.md) -- RISC-V-inspired VLIW 32-bit architecture

## How to Run

### Build Locally

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Haskell Stack via [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/).
3. Run `stack build` to build the project.
4. You have two options to run the project:
    - Run `stack exec wrench -- <ARGS>` to execute the project without installation.
    - Install the project with `stack install` to run it from the command line using `wrench <ARGS>`.

### Install from a Binary Release

1. Open the last master build on the [Actions](https://github.com/ryukzak/wrench/actions).
2. Download the binary for your platform: windows-x64, linux-x64, linux-arm64, macos-intel, macos-arm64.
3. Add the binary to your `PATH`.
4. Run `wrench <ARGS>` to execute the project.

### Via Docker Image

```shell
docker run -it --rm ryukzak/wrench:latest wrench --help
```

### Use it as a Service

This service will be used to send laboratory works to check.

1. Open service:
    - Last release: [wrench.edu.swampbuds.me](https://wrench.edu.swampbuds.me).
    - Edge version (master branch): [wrench-edge.edu.swampbuds.me](https://wrench-edge.edu.swampbuds.me)
    - Service usage statistics: [PostHog](https://eu.posthog.com/shared/UAxD9XvX9pnOjWOah6l_AHCO36zPnA)
2. Fill the form and submit.
3. Check the results.

## Usage

```shell
$ wrench --help
Usage: wrench INPUT --isa ISA [-c|--conf CONF] [-S] [-v|--verbose]
              [--instruction-limit LIMIT] [--memory-limit SIZE]
              [--state-log-limit LIMIT]

  App for laboratory course of computer architecture.

Available options:
  INPUT                    Input assembler file (.s)
  --isa ISA                ISA (risc-iv-32, f32a, acc32, m68k, vliw-iv)
  -c,--conf CONF           Configuration file (.yaml)
  -S                       Only run preprocess and translation steps
  -v,--verbose             Verbose output
  --instruction-limit LIMIT
                           Maximum number of instructions to execute
                           (default: 8000000)
  --memory-limit SIZE      Maximum memory size in bytes (default: 8192)
  --state-log-limit LIMIT  Maximum number of state records to log
                           (default: 10000)
  -h,--help                Show this help text
  --version                Show version information
```

The `wrench` app requires an input assembler file and optionally a configuration file. The assembler file should contain the source code in the ISA-specific assembly language. The configuration file is a YAML file that specifies various settings and parameters for the simulation. Alternatively, you can specify execution limits directly via command-line arguments.

See our [documentation](./docs/README.md) for detailed information about:

- Generic assembly structure
- Configuration file format and options
- Architecture-specific details

### Execution and memory statistics

Reports can include opt-in stat variables that summarize the run -- instructions executed, declared section sizes, and the address ranges actually touched at runtime. Add them to any report's `view` template (typically with `slice: last`):

```yaml
reports:
    - name: stats
      slice: last
      view: |
        sim:instruction-count: {sim:instruction-count}
        layout:sections-size:  {layout:sections-size}
        mem:instr-ranges:      {mem:instr-ranges}
        mem:data-ranges:       {mem:data-ranges}
        mem:io-ranges:         {mem:io-ranges}
```

Comparing `layout:*-size` against `mem:*-ranges` shows which declared bytes the program actually touched and which addresses it accessed outside any declared section (the stack region is the typical case).

For the same picture in one shot, drop `{memory:table}` into a `view` -- it renders the whole address space as a single table (one row per declared section, IO cluster, or free span) with a `Coverage` column:

```yaml
reports:
    - name: memory-map
      slice: last
      view: |
        {memory:table}
```

The full list of variables, including the byte-count vs. range conventions and the `:dec`/`:hex` suffix on range variables, is in the [configuration documentation](./docs/README.md#view).

## Examples

### Factorial Calculation Example (RISC-IV)

Task: Calculate the factorial of a number `n` (`n!`) in RISC-IV architecture.

- Input: Read `n` from memory-mapped I/O address 0x80
- Output: Write the result to memory-mapped I/O address 0x84
- Source Code: [factorial.s](./example/risc-iv-32/factorial.s)
- Configuration: [factorial-5.yaml](./example/risc-iv-32/factorial-5.yaml)
- Run the example:

    ```shell
    # Translation only
    stack exec wrench -- example/risc-iv-32/factorial.s -c example/risc-iv-32/factorial-5.yaml -S

    # Full simulation
    stack exec wrench -- example/risc-iv-32/factorial.s -c example/risc-iv-32/factorial-5.yaml
    ```
