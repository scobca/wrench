# VLIW-IV Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Documentation

The VLIW ISA is a simple register-based instruction set inspired by VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) principles and RISC-V. This documentation provides an overview of the instructions available in the VLIW ISA, their syntax, and their semantics.

## Architecture Overview

The VLIW architecture is a 32-bit VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) architecture inspired by RISC-V and classic VLIW designs. It features:

- 32 general-purpose registers (including one hardwired zero register — writes to `Zero` are silently ignored)
- Fixed-length 11-byte (90-bit) instruction bundles, divided into 4 slots for parallel execution
- Load-store architecture (memory access only through specific instructions in dedicated slots)
- Simple addressing modes
- Memory-mapped I/O
- Support for function calls and returns through jump-and-link instructions
- Arithmetic, logical, and control flow operations executed in parallel where possible
- Static scheduling: The compiler/assembler bundles independent operations; hardware executes them in lockstep

This architecture emphasizes instruction-level parallelism (ILP) through wide instructions, making it ideal for educational exploration of VLIW concepts like compiler scheduling, slot utilization, and parallelism trade-offs, while maintaining RISC-like simplicity in individual operations.

Comments in VLIW assembly code are denoted by the `;` character.

Inspired by [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/riscv-spec-v2.2.pdf) and classic VLIW designs.

## Immediate Value Relocation Directives

The VLIW assembly language provides special directives for handling larger immediate values that don't fit within the standard instruction formats similar to RISC-IV implementation:

- **%hi(symbol)**
    - **Description:** Used to extract the upper 20 bits of a 32-bit address or immediate value
    - **Usage:** `lui rd, %hi(symbol) / nop / nop / nop`
    - **Operation:** `rd <- (symbol & 0xFFFFF000)`

- **%lo(symbol)**
    - **Description:** Used to extract the lower 12 bits of a 32-bit address or immediate value
    - **Usage:** `addi rd, rs, %lo(symbol) / nop / nop / nop`
    - **Operation:** `rd <- rs + (symbol & 0x00000FFF)`

These directives are typically used together to load a full 32-bit address into a register:

```assembly
lui  a0, %hi(address)     / nop / nop / nop ; Load upper 20 bits into a0
addi a0, a0, %lo(address) / nop / nop / nop ; Add lower 12 bits to a0
```

## Instructions

Instruction size: 11 bytes (90-bit bundle).

```text
[SLOT 0]   alu 1: 20 bits     <opcode:5><r1:5><r2:5><r3:5>
[SLOT 1]   alu 2: 20 bits     <opcode:5><r1:5><r2:5><r3:5>
[SLOT 2]   memory: 36 bits    <opcode:4><addr:32>
[SLOT 3]   control: 14 bits   <opcode:4><offset or offset+register:10>
```

Each instruction is a bundle with 4 slots: Slot 0 (ALU1), Slot 1 (ALU2), Slot 2 (Memory), Slot 3 (Control). Operations in slots execute in parallel. Unused slots are NOP (no operation). Assembly syntax uses `/` to separate slots.

**Execution model:** All source operands are read first, then all results are written back simultaneously. The order of register writes from ALU1, ALU2, and Memory slots is non-deterministic — if multiple slots write to the same register, the result is undefined. The control slot always executes last. The compiler/assembler must ensure that parallel operations in the same bundle are independent (no write-write or read-write conflicts across slots).

```assembly
add rd, rs1, rs2 / addi rd, rs1, k / lw rd, offset(rs1) / beq rs1, rs2, k
```

## ISA Specific State Views

- `<reg>:dec`, `<reg>:hex` -- View the value of a specific register in decimal or hexadecimal format.

Available registers: `Zero`, `Ra`, `Sp`, `Gp`, `Tp`, `T0`, `T1`, `T2`, `S0Fp`, `S1`, `A0`, `A1`, `A2`, `A3`, `A4`, `A5`, `A6`, `A7`, `S2`, `S3`, `S4`, `S5`, `S6`, `S7`, `S8`, `S9`, `S10`, `S11`, `T3`, `T4`, `T5`, `T6`.

### Slot utilization (parallelism)

Each VLIW bundle has four execution slots (memory, ALU1, ALU2, control). A slot containing the corresponding `nop` is idle; everything else counts as active. The simulator tallies how many slots each executed bundle used and exposes two summary view variables. They're typically used with `slice: last` because the values are run-totals.

- `vliw:load-percent` -- average slot utilization across the run, as an integer percent. `(active_slots * 100) / (bundles * 4)`. `25%` means each bundle used one slot on average; `100%` means every slot of every bundle was active.
- `vliw:bundles-by-load` -- histogram rendered as comma-separated `K:N (P%)` entries, one per non-empty bucket. `K` is the active-slot count, `N` is the number of bundles in that bucket, `P` is its percent share of all executed bundles. Empty buckets are skipped. A peak at 1 means a serial program; a peak at 3-4 means the compiler / programmer is exploiting the pipeline.

Example -- print a load summary at the end of the simulation:

```yaml
reports:
    - name: vliw-load
      slice: last
      view: |
        vliw:load-percent:    {vliw:load-percent}
        vliw:bundles-by-load: {vliw:bundles-by-load}
```

For `hello.s` running on this ISA the summary reads:

```text
vliw:load-percent:    81%
vliw:bundles-by-load: 1:3 (9%), 3:16 (48%), 4:14 (42%)
```

— 14 fully-packed bundles (`4:14 (42%)`), 16 three-wide (`3:16 (48%)`), 3 with a single active slot (`1:3 (9%)`), no idle or two-slot bundles.
